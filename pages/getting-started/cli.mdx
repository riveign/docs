In this guide you will get all the information on how to set up and start interacting with the Command Line Interface (CLI)

### What is a CLI?

CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions. With this you can interact directlly with all the services surfaced by Fleek directly from you comand line. Fleek CLI provides a unified command line interface to Fleek Services.

### Install

This package requires minimum Node.js 16. To install the CLI run

``` bash copy
npm install -g @fleekxyz/cli
```

### Usage

The Fleek CLI command has the following structure:

``` bash copy
$ fleek <service> <command> [options and parameters]
```

To view all available services and commands you can use:
```bash copy
$ fleek help
```

### Authentication

All the services in the Fleek CLI require authentication, to do this you have to run

```bash copy
$ fleek login
```
This will trigger the login process, we use Web3Auth to manage authentication. Once the flow is completed you will be greeted like this:

```bash copy
$ fleek login
üîó Opening browser on https://rough-truth-3196.on.fleek.co/login.html?verificationSession=... 
üßë‚Äçüíª Please login to continue
‚úÖ Successfully logged in.
```

If at any point you want to logout yo can do so:

```bash copy
$ fleek logout
‚úÖ Successfully logged out.
```

### Projects

As explained [before](/getting-started#projects), to interact with services you need to have a project selected. This can be managed via the CLI too!

To create a project you can do it like this:

```bash copy
$ fleek projects created
$ ? Enter project name: ‚Ä∫ 
```

When entered a correct name you will be automatically switched to it. Also you can be switching through the different projects usign the 'switch' command that will promt a selector

```bash copy
$ fleek projects switch
‚ùØ   project-1
    project-2
    project-3
```
