# IPFS Pinning

## What is IPFS?

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file storage protocol that allows computers all over the globe to store and serve files as part of a giant peer-to-peer network.

## Pinning a File

### What is Pinning?

Pinning is the mechanism that allows you to tell IPFS to always keep a given object somewhere — the default being your local node, though in this case you will be pinning the object to the Fleek IPFS Node.

### How to pin a file?

There are many different ways that you could use Fleek interfaces to pin a file on IPFS

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

<Tabs items={['CLI', 'SDK', 'UI']}>
  <Tab>
    To pin a file using the CLI you need to be authenticated, with a project seelcted and use the `add` command.
    ```shellscript filename="Pinning a file" copy
        > fleek ipfs add hello.txt
        IPFS Hash: Qmanou5uhcGhyW7noyB7LNFJBZkKcuUZnmpHeQSaidJ367
    ```
    When the file has been uploaded you will get the Content Hash corresponding to the file or directories uploaded. You can user a public IPFS gateway to check the uploaded file, <a href='http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRhFGKcqiG2XzbcsimRpd553HCmotisZtam5b4xFPxWDv'> like this</a>.
